Suppose a system has a primary and a replica. Let's say when a user sends a value, it is committed to the primary and then there is a slight lag and then committed to the replica. Users can choose to read from either the primary or replica. Would this system not be linearizable since its possible the replica reads outdated values? In a similar vein, GFS seems to have this type of structure -- is it linearizable or not?
