When I was implementing the leader heartbeat and follower -> candidate timing, I ran into an issue with the random timeouts. For the leader, I said send a heartbeat every 100 ms. For followers, they should transition to candidate state after 100 + randInt%300 (if it didnt receive heartbeat or grant vote). I thought that if the leader was alive then it would always be able to give heartbeat before the transition. However, I found that every 10 runs or so, I would run into an error where a follower would transition to candidate stage even though a leader was alive. I ended up increasing the timeout for the followers and then everything worked. But what could be the cause of this? Is it network delay that might cause the leaders heartbeat to take longer to reach than expected?
