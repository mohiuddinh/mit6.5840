Suppose you have two transactions T1, T2. In T1, you write to A, write to B, write to A a few more times. In T2, you write to B only. With simple locking, first we acquire lock on A and B for T1, wait for everything to be written, then release lock -- the whole time T2 waits. With 2PL, for T1 we acquire lock on A and B, write to A, write to B and release lock on B, keep writing to A. Once the lock on B is released, T2 can proceed.
