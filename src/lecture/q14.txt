Generally, I'm a bit confused by the role/process of the dry run. My understanding is that when a client sends a request, there is a dry run that's kicked off which tries to figure out what values to return (but without acquiring a lock?). The benefit seems to be that prefetching brings data into main memory. But if you're going to process the client's request anyway (while holding locks), why not just directly do it?
