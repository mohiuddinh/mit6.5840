Client requests data from a chunkserver A and caches its location. That chunkserver A goes down. Some other clients make modifications to the corresponding chunkservers replicas (and their version numbers are incremented). Now chunkserver A comes back online and before the controller can remove this stale replica in its regular garbage collection, the client requests data from it, which will be stale.
