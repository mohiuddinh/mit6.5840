No, it cannot go back in time. In the paragraph below figure 13, it says if a follower receives new information in the snapshot, then the follower will discard its entire log. If the follower receives a snapshot that describes a prefix of its log, then log entries covered by the snapshot are deleted but entries following the snapshot are still valid and must be retained. (If this understanding is incorrect, please do let me know.)
